# Models with higher effective dimensions produce more uncertain estimates

Arnald Puy, Pierfrancesco Beneventano, Samuele Lo Piano, Tommaso Portaluri, Simon A. Levin, Andrea Saltelli

This is the R code of the paper, whose abstract is the following: 

*Mathematical models are routinely used in many scientific fields to predict the behavior of intricate phenomena, gain insights into the dynamics of a system of interest or inform policy-making. In the last decades models have been getting increasingly fine-grained on the assumption that the addition of detail ultimately leads to more accurate outputs. Here we show that model complexification tends instead to yield fuzzier estimates due to the increase in the model's effective dimensions. We use ANOVA and statistical theory to show that more complex models tend to have more active terms and higher-order effects, which increase the output variance. Model-based disciplines may benefit from reconsidering the pursuit of ever-complex models as a mean to progressively constrain uncertainties in our understanding of the world*. 

## Information

We provide the code in `.R`, `.rmd`and `.pdf`. We also provide the dataset `NY.csv`, by Saad-Roy et al. 2020, needed to reproduce our results in the case of the epidemiological models.
