# Models with higher effective dimensions tend to produce more uncertain estimates

Arnald Puy, Pierfrancesco Beneventano, Simon A. Levin, Samuele Lo Piano, Tommaso Portaluri, Andrea Saltelli

This is the R code of the paper, whose abstract is the following: 

*Mathematical models are routinely used to predict the behavior of phenomena, gain insights into the dynamics of a system of interest or inform policy-making. Although it is known that the addition of model detail might boost the output variance, models are nevertheless becoming finer-grained on the assumption that more data, computational power and ever-detailed algorithms will progressively bound uncertainties. Here we show through ANOVA and statistical theory that model complexification tends to promote fuzzier estimates because it generally increases the model's effective dimensions, e.g., the number of active terms and higher-order effects. By tracking the evolution of the effective dimensions and the output uncertainty at each model upgrade stage, modelers can better ponder whether the addition of detail truly matches the model's purpose and the quality of the data fed into it*. 

## Information

We provide the code in `.R`, `.rmd`and `.pdf`. We also provide the dataset `NY.csv`, by Saad-Roy et al. 2020, needed to reproduce our results in the case of the epidemiological models.
